Solving any Assignment - a practical modell

We have two classes:   
  - MainForm 			Handle communication between the user and the app.
  - CurrencyExchange	Needs input from MainForm
						Perform calculations
						Provide output
 Mainform (M) is the client of CurrencyExchange (CE)
 M creates an object of CE
 M owns the object (obj) as its private property
 M accesses all public members of CE
 - members to set input to this object
 - members to make calculations and get output
 
 It is all up to the M how it gets input from the user
 It is all up to the M how it displays the output.

 Any other object of any other class can create an obj of CE 
 and use it in the same way as M, with or with a user on the 
 other end!

 We have now a GUI (M) and CE obj.  M has control!
 Getting input is an important part. 
 You can always use this model:
 In the MainForm:
   - Create an instance of another class (with new), here CE
   - Get the content of a control, a textbox, etc.
   - Validate the input
   - if OK
	   - Save the value in the obj
	   - Let the object do the required calculations by 
	     calling its methods
	   - Update your GUI (M)
	That is ALL

  
READING INPUT:
   - Write one main method:
       



The three steps to remember.
	1. Get input, 
		- Fetch data from controls (Textboxes, listboxes, etc.) 
		  and save it in variables
		- Validate the input based on your conditions
		- If OK go to next step 
		- If not, error message and do nothing

	2. Process data - determine when to do this
		- do calculations, manipulations, etc.
		- save results in variables or in the return value
		  of the method doing the processing.

	3. Display results
		- Get results from your calculations 
		  (variables, or call methods. ).
		- Display on the GUI using the dedicated controls.

		MainForm  (M)  ---> CurrencyEchange (C)
